//! `isekai-ssh` CLI surface (`ISEKAI_SSH_DESIGN.md` "CLIコマンド構成").
//!
//! `connect`, `init`, `login`, and `logout` are implemented; `trust` is still
//! out of scope. As of S-2, `connect` resolves its
//! target from the trust store (`isekai-trust`,
//! `~/.config/isekai-ssh/known_helpers.toml`) by default; the
//! `--dev-insecure-*` flags below remain only as a debug/test-only bypass
//! of that lookup (originally added to unblock S-1's end-to-end test before
//! the trust store existed). They are compiled in *only* when both
//! `debug_assertions` and the (non-default) `dev-insecure` Cargo feature are
//! active — see `main.rs`'s `compile_error!` guard for why a release build
//! can never even have this feature turned on, and this module's `cfg` gate
//! for why a plain (non-`dev-insecure`) debug build's `--help` also never
//! shows them.
//!
//! As of S-6, `connect` also takes `--mode <relay|stun>` (default `relay`)
//! to pick which `isekai-transport` NAT-traversal path resolves the trust
//! store entry into: `ConnectMode::Relay`
//! (`isekai_transport::connect_via_relay`) or `ConnectMode::Stun`
//! (`isekai_transport::connect_stun_p2p`, requiring `--stun-server`). See
//! `ConnectArgs::mode`'s docs and `connect.rs`'s module docs for the
//! relay-first rationale and the STUN mode's known unrecoverable-NAT-loss
//! caveat.
//!
//! `init` (S-3) is the interactive counterpart that populates the trust
//! store `connect` reads from: it deploys/starts `isekai-helper` on a target
//! host (via `isekai-bootstrap::OpenSshBackend`) and, on confirmation, writes
//! a `HelperTrust` entry. See `init.rs`'s module docs for the full flow.
//!
//! `login`/`logout` (S-5) manage the relay JWT `isekai-helper --relay` needs
//! (`init`'s `--relay-jwt` flag, still passed explicitly — wiring `init`'s
//! `--relay-jwt` to default to the logged-in token is future work, not this
//! phase's scope): `login` runs a Device Authorization Grant (RFC 8628)
//! against caller-supplied OAuth endpoints and saves the resulting token via
//! `isekai-auth`; `logout` deletes the saved token file. See `login.rs`'s
//! module docs for the full flow.
