//! `isekai-ssh` CLI surface (`ISEKAI_SSH_DESIGN.md` "CLIコマンド構成").
//!
//! `connect` and `init` are implemented; `login`/`logout`/`trust` are still
//! out of scope (フェーズ分割案 S-5). As of S-2, `connect` resolves its
//! target from the trust store (`isekai-trust`,
//! `~/.config/isekai-ssh/known_helpers.toml`) by default; the
//! `--dev-insecure-*` flags below remain only as a debug/test-only bypass
//! of that lookup (originally added to unblock S-1's end-to-end test before
//! the trust store existed). They are compiled in *only* when both
//! `debug_assertions` and the (non-default) `dev-insecure` Cargo feature are
//! active — see `main.rs`'s `compile_error!` guard for why a release build
//! can never even have this feature turned on, and this module's `cfg` gate
//! for why a plain (non-`dev-insecure`) debug build's `--help` also never
//! shows them.
//!
//! `init` (S-3) is the interactive counterpart that populates the trust
//! store `connect` reads from: it deploys/starts `isekai-helper` on a target
//! host (via `isekai-bootstrap::OpenSshBackend`) and, on confirmation, writes
//! a `HelperTrust` entry. See `init.rs`'s module docs for the full flow.
